## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use useReducer to manage the state of the app. I also learned how to use the useEffect hook to handle side effects in functional components. This was particularly useful for updating the total amount when the bill or tip percentage changes.


### Continued development

I plan to continue learning about React and its ecosystem. I want to explore more advanced topics like context API, custom hooks, and performance optimization. I also want to improve my CSS skills, especially with Tailwind CSS.
